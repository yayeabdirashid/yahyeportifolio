# Portfolio Website - Yahye Abdirashid Mohamed

Welcome to the source code for my personal portfolio website. This project is designed to showcase my skills, experience, and passion for IT and Web Development through a modern, responsive, and visually engaging interface.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

This project was built using pure, vanilla web technologies to ensure maximum performance and control over the design.

- **HTML5**: Used for the semantic structure of the website, ensuring accessibility and SEO friendliness.
- **CSS3**:
  - **Custom Properties (Variables)**: For consistent color auditing and easy theming.
  - **Flexbox & Grid**: For modern, responsive layouts that adapt to any screen size.
  - **Glassmorphism**: Using transparent backgrounds and blur filters (`backdrop-filter`) to create a premium, layered depth effect.
  - **Animations**: Keyframe animations for background blobs and hover effects.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**:
  - **Intersection Observer API**: For high-performance scroll animations that trigger when elements enter the viewport.
  - **DOM Manipulation**: For the mobile navigation toggle and smooth scrolling behavior.
- **External Assets**:
  - **Font Awesome**: For vector icons (social media, contact info, skills).
  - **Google Fonts**: 'Outfit' typeface for a clean, modern geometric look.

## ✨ Features

- **Responsive Design**: Fully optimized for Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile devices.
- **Dynamic Background**: Animated colorful blobs that create a lively, organic feel without distraction.
- **Smooth Navigation**: Integrated smooth scrolling for a seamless user experience.
- **Interactive UI**: subtle hover states and entrance animations to engage visitors.
